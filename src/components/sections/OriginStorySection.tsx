              It started with a broken computer and an insatiable curiosity. While other kids played outside, 
              I was dismantling electronics, fascinated by the intricate dance of circuits and code that 
              brought machines to life.
            </p>
            <p>
              That pivotal moment came at age 12 when I successfully fixed our family computerâ€”not just 
              hardware, but diving deep into the software that made it tick. The rush of problem-solving, 
              the satisfaction of creation, the endless possibilities ahead. That&apos;s when I knew.
