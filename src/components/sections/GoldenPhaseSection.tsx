              The breakthrough moment: leading a team that built something people actually loved and used. 
              Scaling from hundreds to thousands of users, each feature decision carrying real weight, 
              real impact on real lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              Key wins included architecting systems that could handle massive growth, mentoring junior 
              developers who became leaders themselves, and that one project that got featured in industry 
              publications. Not just for the technical achievement, but for solving a genuine human problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              This phase taught me that great technology isn&apos;t about complexityâ€”it&apos;s about clarity, 
              reliability, and the seamless experience that makes users forget they&apos;re using technology at all.
